##Financial Support to Ukraine Choropleth Map


This is a choropleth map showing financial support provided to Ukraine as a percentage of each donating country's 2021 GDP. The data used, accounts for money already spent as well as future allocations countries plan to deliver. The data accounts for financial assistance between the dates of 01/24/2022 and 08/31/2025. The figures are representative of total aid provided including both humanitarian and military, however this “does not include private donations, support for refugees outside of Ukraine and aid by international organizations”. The objective of this map is to provide a visual representation of support for Ukraine. This map does not account for the difference in size of countries' GDPs but provides a good visual representation of who is providing support and to what extent. It shows which countries are spending the largest percentage of their respective GDPs to back Ukraine and also reveals a possible relationship between how much countries are spending in relation to their physical distance from Russia. The map includes pop ups, which provide the exact percentage of each country's GDP that they are spending. It also includes filters allowing the user to sort by EU and non EU countries. I provided this sort feature because the majority of countries represented on this map are part of the EU, this allows the user to see what support would look like without the EU and makes it easier to view countries in the surrounding area.
